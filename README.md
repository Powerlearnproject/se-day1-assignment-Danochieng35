2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


The field of software engineering has undergone significant changes since its inception, with several key milestones shaping its development over the decades. These milestones have not only advanced the discipline but have also influenced how software is designed, developed, and maintained today.

i. The Introduction of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)
   
Structured programming was introduced during the late 1960s as a response to the increasing complexity and unpredictability in software development. This approach emphasizes the importance of dividing a program into smaller, logical sections or modules, each of which performs a specific task. Structured programming encourages the use of control structures like loops and conditionals instead of the "goto" statement, which was common in early programming. By promoting clear, modular code, structured programming made it easier for developers to write, debug, and maintain software, and it laid the groundwork for many modern programming practices.

ii. The Development of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s)
   
In the 1980s, object-oriented programming (OOP) brought about a fundamental shift in how software systems were conceptualized and built. OOP is based on the idea of "objects"—self-contained entities that include both data and the methods that operate on that data. This approach allows developers to model complex systems more naturally by mimicking real-world entities and their interactions. OOP also introduced key concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, which facilitate code reuse and flexibility. Programming languages such as C++, Java, and later Python, embraced OOP principles, and they have since become some of the most widely used languages in the industry.

iii. The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2000s)
   
The early 2000s saw the emergence of Agile methodologies, which represented a significant departure from traditional, rigid software development processes. Agile emphasizes adaptability, customer collaboration, and the ability to respond quickly to changing requirements. It promotes iterative development, where software is built incrementally with frequent reassessments and adjustments. The publication of the Agile Manifesto in 2001 formalized this approach, and it has since become a dominant force in software development. Agile methodologies have led to the widespread adoption of frameworks like Scrum and Kanban, which help teams deliver software more efficiently and with a higher degree of customer satisfaction.




3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


The Software Development Life Cycle is a systematic process used by software engineers to design, develop, test, and deploy software. It consists of several distinct phases, each of which plays a crucial role in ensuring that the final product meets the desired requirements and quality standards:

i.	Planning - this is the initial phase where the scope of the project is defined, and requirements are gathered from stakeholders. A project plan is created, outlining the timeline, resources, and deliverables.   

ii.	Design - the design phase involves creating a blueprint for the software. This includes system architecture, database design, and user interface design.  

iii.	Development - in this phase, developers write the actual code based on the design specifications. This involves using programming languages and tools to create the software. 

iv.	Testing - once the code is written, it undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix any bugs or defects. Different types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing, are conducted.   

v.	Deployment - after successful testing, the software is deployed to the production environment. This involves installing the software on servers or devices where it will be used. 

vi.	Maintenance - even after deployment, the software requires ongoing maintenance. This includes fixing bugs, adding new features, and making improvements to ensure the software continues to meet user needs.   




4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


The Waterfall and Agile methodologies are two popular approaches to software development, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

Waterfall Methodology

The Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach to software development. It is characterized by distinct phases that must be completed before moving on to the next, with little to no overlap. The typical phases include requirements gathering, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase in Waterfall must be fully completed before the next begins.

Agile Methodology

In contrast, Agile is an iterative and flexible approach to software development. Agile methodologies focus on breaking down the development process into small, manageable increments called sprints, typically lasting two to four weeks. Each sprint involves planning, development, testing, and review, allowing teams to continuously refine and improve the software based on stakeholder feedback. Agile emphasizes adaptability, collaboration, and customer involvement throughout the development process

The choice between Waterfall and Agile depends on various factors such as:

i.	Project size and complexity - smaller, simpler projects may benefit from Waterfall, while larger, more complex projects may require Agile.

ii.	Required stability - if requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change, Waterfall might be suitable. If requirements are expected to evolve, Agile is more adaptable.




5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
